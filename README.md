## safepaths

An R package ðŸ“¦ to safely set & use a path to a private network.

### Features

The package has 3 functions to safely set & use a path to a private network:

 - `set_network_path()`: adds an environment variable called `SAFEPATHS_NETWORK_PATH` to
    your `.Renviron` file and sets the variable to a provided network
    path.
    
 - `get_network_path()`: retrieves the environment variable `SAFEPATHS_NETWORK_PATH`, which is stored in your `.Renviron` file using `set_network_path()`.
 
 - `use_network_path()`: retrieves and uses the stored network path in conjunction with a  provided file or folder path. 
 
 
```{r}
use_network_path("file.csv")
use_network_path("folder_name/file.csv")
```
